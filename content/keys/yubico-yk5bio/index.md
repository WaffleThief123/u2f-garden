summary: Yubico's first fingerprint token
---

Yubico's fingerprint enabled token, the Yubico 5 Bio, is a step back (or to the side) in the world of the Yubico offerings. 
Lacking any of the Yubico proprietary options, the Yubikey 5 Bio supports only U2F interactions, lacks any NFC, and lacks even the traditional management application.
