FeiTian's NFC offerings bring more to the table than their non-NFC counterparts. 
Most notably, other than NFC, is a wider support offering for credential storage:
These keys support FIDO2 Resident credentials, allowing sites and applications to
store more powerful content on them. 

Additionally, FeiTian offers SmartCard functionality on these cards as an option
that can be customized if you wish. 

## TOTP and HOTP

TOTP and HOTP must be configured through the Windows-only management application.
