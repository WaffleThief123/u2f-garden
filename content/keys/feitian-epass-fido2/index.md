FeiTian's series of ePass FIDO2 authenticators are a wide series. Each "casing" is a different form-factor:

* The A4B is a traditional "key" shape
* The K10 is intended to come close to flush with the USB connector, similar to the Yubikey Nano series
* The K12 is a stick form-factor.
* The K21 and K28 offer USB-C connectors in a compact form-factor
* The K39 provides a simple, easy USB-C stick format.

Feitian is the OEM for many other vendors, with various options turned on or off for those specific users.
