summary: Feitian's biometric options bring fingerprint authentication for additional security
---

FeiTian's biometric offerings come in two different formats:

* the multi-interface AlinPass devices, which are intended for Azure AD and other cloud/enterprise environments
* the K26 and K27 form-factors, which are FIDO2 U2F certified biometric-backed authenticators. 

The first are a part of FeiTian's enterprise authentication stack. These are multiprotocol devices that speak bluetooth, NFC, and USB. These aren't as suitable for individual use, but can make for powerful authenticators in an enterprise environment. 

The second are best described as "biometric versions of the FIDO2 tokens." The K27 is notable for an all-metal exterior shell, soft-touch metal surrounding a large fingerprint reader. The K26 is very similar to the ePass FIDO series, with much of the same features. 

Upon request, FeiTian does offer PIV card support for the K26/K27 models. 

## Management 

Fingerprint management can be done either with the [provided FeiTian software](https://www.ftsafe.com/Support/Resources?tree_id=213) on any platform or with Google Chrome under MacOS and Linux. 

## Resident credentials

When unlocking resident credentials, only the PIN is used.

## Fingerprint gating

Fingerprints are used when registering the device with a new service or authenticating a service with the device through a browser or other similar utility.
