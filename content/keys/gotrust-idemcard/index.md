GoTrust's IdemCard is a unique offering. For those who need SmartCard access, this can definitely be an option. 

Paired with their IdemKey, the IdemCard makes a great one-two punch solution for securing accounts.
The hitch here is that you'll need to either have a laptop with bluetooth or be able to set up the card with a phone.
This means that if you're using Google's 2FA, you'll need to do some legwork.
HowToGeek has a [comprehensive tutorial](https://www.howtogeek.com/365045/how-to-set-up-and-use-the-google-titan-key-bundle/) on setting up Bluetooth tokens using a phone.
