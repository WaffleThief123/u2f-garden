Title: Why use U2F Tokens?
draft: false

---

When you log into a website, you're probably used to using your username and password.
Increasingly, however, phishing and other social engineering attacks are getting better and better.
In a modern world, hardware security tokens like U2F tokens help keep attackers from taking advantage of us.

# What is Two-Factor authentication?

Two factor authentication (2FA) is a way that websites can secure accounts.
In order to log in, you must present two forms of authentication:

* Something you know (a *password*)
* Something you have (such as a one-time password)
* Something you control (such as a phone app)

Security standards organizations like NIST, who set the standards for security that many Government and Fortune 100 Organizations use as policy, have reccomended moving away on the reliance on things you memorize, like passwords, and further onto controlled authentication devices.

# Why using it matters

By using two forms of authentication, you make it harder for malicious individuals to impersonate you. Website breaches happen on an unfortunately regular basis; websites like [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) have been showing how important it is to choose strong passwords. 

Passwords are only one step of your security system. You should be using the 'Something you Know, Something you Have, Something you Control' method that you learned about earlier on this page. 
Risks of not following this system can include (but are not limited to) the following.  

* Gaining access to your Google account creates a means to change your passwords elsewhere
* If someone changes your bank password, they can control parts of your finances
* Websites like PayPal, CashApp, and even Facebook can be used to ruin your life financially and socially if out of your own control

By using a second factor of authentication, you're creating a security *system*, not just a single layer of security.
