The Yubikey Nano devices are intended to be stored long-term in a USB port, either in a laptop, dock, or hub and do not support NFC. 

The 5th generation of devices introduced the [Yubikey 5ci](keys/yubikey5ci/), which includes a Lightning connector for use with iOS devices, as well
as a USB-C port for desktop use.

As of the 5th generation, both full size Yubikey devices support NFC.
