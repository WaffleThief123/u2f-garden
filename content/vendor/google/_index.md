Google's [Advanced Protection Program](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/) has been a key part in
raising the water line of security in Google accounts of those who are at higher risk. 

While it is not required to be in the Advanced Proteciton Program, it is suggested for anyone whose Google account
is potentially a high value target, such as youtubers with 10K+ subscribers and local politicians.

Google partners with the [Defending Digital Campaigns](https://www.defendcampaigns.org/partners) program to enhance the security of modern day elections across the world.
